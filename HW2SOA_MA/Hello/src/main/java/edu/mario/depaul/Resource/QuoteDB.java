 * To ensure that the data is stored properly I created a somewhat quote database.
 * I instantiated here because if I did it in Qservice then I couldn't delete the preset quote 1-5.
 * Thus having it separated and instantiating at within the class made sense
 * Mapping made it easy to manipulate the data.
